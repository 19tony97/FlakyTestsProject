# FlakyTestsProject
The main goal of this project is to develop techniques to identify the presence of flaky tests in source code by employing various machine learning classifiers on a dataset of test case characteristics. Secondly, we are interested in determining whether the usage of genetic algorithms can enhance the performances of these predictors by a non-ignorable margin, and also when compared with traditional statistical feature selection methods, such as information gain.
